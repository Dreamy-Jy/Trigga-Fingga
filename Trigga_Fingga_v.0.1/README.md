## So far
I have the button working properly and the counter work up for numbers 0-9.

### Materials used:
- 1x [Arduino Uno R3](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/arduinoBoardUno)
- 1X Button Circuit:
    - 1x [Push Button](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/97)
    - 1x [10k Resistor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8374)
    - 2x [Jumper Cable](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8431)
- 1x Counter Circuit:
    - 1x [Shift Register|SN74HC595N](https://store.ti.com/SN74HC595N.aspx)
    - 1x [Common Cathode 7 Segment Display](https://www.amazon.com/uxcell-Cathode-Segment-Display-Digital/dp/B00EZBGUMC/ref=pd_sim_23_1?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B00EZBGUMC&pd_rd_r=34MKJFF56QAQ9K0NMX0K&pd_rd_w=NurAG&pd_rd_wg=JxY8T&psc=1&refRID=34MKJFF56QAQ9K0NMX0K)
    - 1x 1.5k Ohm Resistor
    - 14x Jumper Cables

## Where I wanted to be
I was hoping that I would have the counter counting in double digits, and I be working on smoothing out any glitches that result in pressing Trigga Fingga while the sound from a previous press is still playing. Though due to this being my first electronics project I found myself faced with the steep learning curve one faces when they're trying to teach themselves.

## Where I plan to be
By the end of the week I hope to have the counter counting in double digits, and to start the sound circuit. Then later on introduce the charger circuit.
